        <p>Between work and leisure, I spend a fair amount of time modifying my energy, attention, and mood with (legal, acceptable) substances. This appears to be a pillar of many adults’ routines.<p>
        <p>Since September 2018 (when I started my first full-time job after graduation) I've been noting every coffee and alcoholic drink I've had by the hour in which it was mostly consumed. (This timing and what amount constitutes "one drink" is fungible. This is soft and round personal data.)</p>
        <p>I wanted to see a graphed routine of the ways I push and pull into focus, attention, and candor.</p>
