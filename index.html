        <h1>Drinks</h1>
        <p>Between work and leisure, I spend a fair amount of time modifying my energy, attention, and mood with (legal, acceptable) substances. This appears to be a pillar of many adults’ routines.<p>

        <p>Since September 2018, (when I started my first full-time job after graduation,) I've been noting every <span class="coffee">coffee</span> and <span class="wine">alcoholic</span> drink I've had by the hour in which it was mostly consumed.</p>

        <p>(This timing and what amount constitutes "one drink" is fungible. This is soft and round personal data.)</p>

        <p>I wanted to see a graphed routine of the ways I push and pull into focus, attention, and candor.</p>
